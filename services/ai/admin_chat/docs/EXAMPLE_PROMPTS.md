1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "show claims", try "show me claim volume by state"
2. **Use Natural Language**: "How many..." works better than "COUNT..."
3. **Request Charts**: Add "generate a chart" or "show me a graph" for visualizations
4. **Specify Timeframes**: "this month", "last 30 days", "October 2025"
5. **Ask for Comparisons**: "compare X and Y" generates comparison charts
