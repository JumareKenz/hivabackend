### provider_faq_retouched.docx

1. General Portal Access & Login Issues
Q: I can’t log in or the portal is not loading at all. A:
Try a different browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended) or use incognito/private mode.
Clear browser cache and cookies.
Switch network (MTN ↔ Glo ↔ Airtel). Many “portal down” issues are network-related.
If you see a blank white screen after login, type the URL directly: https://app.claimify.ng (or your state-specific URL) and log in again.
Q: It says “Incorrect username or password” even though I’m using euhler as password. A:
Username is usually your email address
Password is case-sensitive: type euhler exactly (lowercase)  by default.
If still not working, ask your admin/ICT to reset your account.
2. Authorization Code Problems
Q: Authorization code is not displaying / blank / shows “0682491537” or wrong code. A:
Do NOT log out. Simply refresh/reload the page (F5 or pull down on mobile).
If still blank, take a screenshot and send to ICT with enrollee ID and facility name.
Common fix: ICT resets the code at the backend within minutes–hours.
Q: It says “CODE USED” even though I haven’t used it yet. A:
This happens when the page times out or you started the claim earlier.
Do NOT request a new code. Go to “Manage Claims” → select the existing draft claim → continue from there.
If still blocked, send enrollee ID, auth code, and facility name to ICT.
Q: I requested a code yesterday but it’s still pending approval. A:
Codes need approval from the state agency (OSHIA/KGSHIA etc.).
Urgent cases (C/S, dialysis, etc.): tag ICT with diagnosis and enrollee ID — they escalate.
3. Claims Submission Issues
Q: When preparing a claim, it says “CODE USED” for a patient admitted twice. A:
A new authorization code is needed for each new admission/episode, even same patient.
Request a fresh code; old one becomes invalid once used.
Q: Enrollee name/details not showing when I search. A:
Search using ANY of these: OHIS/KGSHIA ID, phone number, NIN, first name, or surname.
If still not found, the enrollee may not be fully synced — contact ICT with full details.
Q: Beneficiary (dependant) name not appearing, only principal shows. A:
Common for newly added dependants.
Principal must visit the state insurance agency HQ (or send a family member) with documents to update records.
Cannot be fixed remotely.
Q: “Drugs/Services” dropdown is empty or not loading. A:
Refresh page.
Make sure you selected the correct benefit package for that enrollee.
Q: I filled everything but when I click “Submit” nothing happens or says “undefined”. A:
Clear cache, switch network, or try a different device/browser.
If using email field during enrollment, it must be unique (no two people can have same email).
Email is NOT compulsory for informal/vulnerable group enrollees.
4. Referral Issues
Q: I need to refer a patient but can’t generate referral code. A:
First request normal authorization code.
After approval, go to “Referral” module to generate referral code to secondary/tertiary facility.
5. Server Downtime & Maintenance
Q: Portal suddenly stops working in the middle of the day. A:
Planned maintenance is announced in the WhatsApp groups (usually 11 PM – 6 AM or 1-hour windows).
Unplanned downtime: wait 5–30 minutes and refresh.
6. Offline Enrollment (Rivers & FCT BHCPF)
Q: No network in the village, how do I enroll? A:
The offline version rarely works reliably.
Best practice: capture details manually in a register + take passport photos → enroll later when you have network.
7. Duplicate Facilities / Wrong Facility Selected
Q: My hospital name appears twice in the dropdown. A:
Always select the one with the correct/full name.
Report duplicates to ICT so they can merge/remove.
8. Common Quick Fixes (Try in this order)
Refresh page (F5)
Log out → log in again
Switch network
Clear browser cache
Use Chrome incognito
Screenshot the exact error + enrollee ID + facility name → send to ICT group
9. Who to Contact
Osun (OSHIA): Rising Felix, Faisal Hayok Medicare, Faruk dpee Hayok
Kogi (KGSHIA): Danjuma Hayok, Faisal, Rising Felix
